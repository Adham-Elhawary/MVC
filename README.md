## 📘 About

This project showcases a fundamental setup of an ASP.NET Core MVC web application:

- **Models**: Define the application's data logic.
- **Views**: Razor views that present data in HTML.
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and orchestrate data flow.

Originally developed for **DEPI**, it can serve as a starter template or learning resource for MVC architecture.

---

## ✨ Features

- Standard MVC pattern with strong separation of concerns
- Simple routing to connect HTTP requests to controller actions
- Razor-based view templates
- Model binding and server-side validation
- Easily extendable with authentication, databases, services, etc.
